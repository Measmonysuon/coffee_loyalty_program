# Coffee Shop Loyalty Program (Telegram Bot)

A simple loyalty program where customers collect points for each purchase. Once they accumulate enough points, they can redeem them for a free coffee or other rewards. The program allows customers to check their points, redeem rewards, and receive special offers directly through a Telegram bot interface.

## Concept

This loyalty program allows a small coffee shop to engage with customers through a Telegram bot, offering a seamless way to collect and redeem points for purchases. Customers can easily check their points and be notified of special offers or promotions.

## Features

1. **Register**: Customers can register for the loyalty program.
2. **Track Points**: Customers earn points for every purchase.
3. **Check Points**: Customers can check their current points using the bot.
4. **Redeem Rewards**: Customers can redeem points for rewards once they have collected enough.
5. **Notify**: The bot can send special offers and reward notifications to customers.
6. **Admin Panel**: Admins can add or reset points for users and manage the loyalty program.

## Flow
